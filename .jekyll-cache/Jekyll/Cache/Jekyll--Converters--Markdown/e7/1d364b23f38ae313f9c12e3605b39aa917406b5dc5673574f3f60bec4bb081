I"4<h3 class="PostH1">Personal Goals </h3>
<p>For my personal Goals I have a few in mind. Some may seem easy and other won’t, reason for the variety is as I want to challenge myself as well as have fun. If the goals don’t challenge you to a certain extent then there’s no point of them. Mine are Technical Goals as this is the area I want to improve this year!</p>
<h6 class="PostH1"> My goals this year include:</h6>
<ul>
<li><h5>Post at least one blog per month</h5></li>
<li><h5>Learn Python to an Advanced level</h5></li>
<li><h5>Use a new tool/ software every month</h5></li>
<li><h5>Improve my web dev skills </h5></li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>

<h3 class="PostH1">Placement Goals </h3>
<p>I have recently reached the 6th month mark in my placement and I have achieved my goals I set for myself at this point. I really want to expand my network and skills and the best way I see this happening is by working with people across the business in areas I wouldn’t necessarily work with.</p>
<h6 class="PostH1"> My goals this year include:</h6>
<ul>
<li><h5>Present Externally</h5> </li>
<li><h5>Complete Current Data Migration Successfully</h5></li>
<li><h5>Branch out to teams in R&amp;D or Manufacturing</h5></li>
<li><h5>Improve internal Communication</h5></li>
<li><h5></h5></li>
</ul>

<p>I will be writing an update post every now and again with a progress report which will likely be linked below this if one exists.</p>
