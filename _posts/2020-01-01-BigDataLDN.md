There were 4 'technical talk' theatres Confernece halls and 4 'Strategy Sessions' where comapines would come and talk about either something they are working on or created or a particular problem/ concept. 

### Why did I go? ### 
I attended this conference for many reasons. My reasons where both personal and business related as I could use the knowledge gained at this event to better myself and also bring insightful information back to the company Im currently working for. Here's some of the reasons why I went:

### What I learnt: ###
During the [IBM talk](https://bigdataldn.com/seminar-schedule/how-ai-gives-you-superpowers/) presented by **Rob Thomas** (General Manager - IBM Data & AI), he spoke a lot about AI and the direction businesses can go towards using AI.

Firstly AI (Artificial Intelligence) is intelligence showed by a computer/machine which is simillar to natural intelligence showed by us humans.
