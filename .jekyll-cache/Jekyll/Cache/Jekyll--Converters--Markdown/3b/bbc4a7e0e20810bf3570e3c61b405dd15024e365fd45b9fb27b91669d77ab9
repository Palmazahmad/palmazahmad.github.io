I"r<h3 class="PostH1">Personal Goals </h3>
<p>For my personal Goals I have a few in mind. Some may seem easy and other won’t, reason for the variety is as I want to challenge myself as well as have fun. If the goals don’t challenge you to a certain extent then there’s no point of them. Mine are technical Goals as this is the area I want to improve this year! - My goals this year include:</p>
<ul>
<li><h5>Post at least one blog per month</h5></li>
<li><h5>Learn Python to an Advanced level</h5></li>
<li><h5>Use a new tool/ software every month</h5></li>
<li><h5>Improve my web dev skills </h5></li>
</ul>
