<h3 class="PostH1">What I learnt:</h3>
<p>During the <a href="https://bigdataldn.com/seminar-schedule/how-ai-gives-you-superpowers/">IBM talk</a> presented by <strong>Rob Thomas</strong> (General Manager - IBM Data &amp; AI), he spoke a lot about AI and the direction businesses can go towards using AI.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AI is: <i>â€˜Predictions + Automation + Optimisationâ€™</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly AI (Artificial Intelligence) is intelligence showed by a computer/machine which is simillar to natural intelligence showed by us humans.  <b><i>â€˜AI is only as good as your dataâ€™</i></b> - Very true, if data is bad then AI intelligence is bad which results to weak decision making leading to bad results.</p>
