<h3 class="PostH1">  What is Big Data LDN? </h3>
Big Data LDN (London) is a tech conferenece focusing on Data. It's a free two day event held in Olympia London, honestly it's a combination between a 'Conference' and an 'Exibition'. There were 4 'technical talk' theatres Confernece halls and 4 'Strategy Sessions' where comapines would come and talk about either something they are working on or created or a particular problem/ concept. 

<h3 class="PostH1">  Why did I go? </h3> 
I attended this conference for many reasons. My reasons where both personal and business related as I could use the knowledge gained at this event to better myself and also bring insightful information back to the company Im currently working for. Here's some of the reasons why I went:
 <ul>
<li> <h5> To Network </h5></li>
<li> <h5> Understand Data's progression in Industry</h5></li>
<li> <h5> Attend my first major professional conference. </h5></li>
<li> <h5> What companies are trying to do with their Data.</h5></li>
<li> <h5> Find out What tools are out there</h5></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="PostH1">IBM - 'WATSON'</h3>
During the [IBM talk](https://bigdataldn.com/seminar-schedule/how-ai-gives-you-superpowers/) presented by **Rob Thomas** (General Manager - IBM Data & AI), he spoke a lot about AI and the direction businesses can go towards using AI.

>AI is: <i>'Predictions + Automation + Optimisation'  

Firstly AI (Artificial Intelligence) is intelligence showed by a computer/machine which is simillar to natural intelligence showed by us humans.  <b><i>'AI is only as good as your data'</i></b> - Very true, if data is bad then AI intelligence is bad which results to weak decision making leading to bad results.

The reason for the AI heavy talk, 'Watson' - a tool/ service IBM offer to help other business use AI. Throughout the talk Mr Thomas Spoke about the benifits of AI and why its the future. But that's a Converstation for another day. 

One key takeaway was the importance of good data. Good data can enable business to be more effiecent as the data they have can optimise processes and increase efficiency. Again this is a converstation for another blog.

<h3 class="PostH1">  Some Intresting Facts - </h3>
<ul>
<li> <h5>In the last two years -> 90% of all data has been collected. </h5></li>
<li> <h5>only around 9% of business deal with <i>'Data Maturity'</i></h5></li>
<ul><li> <h6> Problems which they face include - 'Complexity & Security'</h6></li></ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <h5> Only 10% of business have adopted AI </h5></li>
<li> <h5> Information drives value (Business value)</h5></li><ul>
<li> <h6>2009 Largest Companies included - PetroChina, Exxon Mobil, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, China Mobile, Microsoft. (Only two out of top 10 Companies are tech related)</h6></li>
<li> <h6> 2019 Largest Companies included - 
    Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Berkshire Hathaway (8 out of top 10 Companies)</h6></li>
</ul></ul>

<h3 class="PostH1"> What It made me realise: </h3>

During my placement I've noticed many things, one being having good organised data is easier said than done - I found this out the hard way! I started by doing some basic anaylsis on some of our data and came to some shocking conclusions. 

Some objects / fields weren't even being used often or at all, we were collecting data which wasn't benifiting us as all. Overall our data was a mess and we weren't utilising it well enough. Since then we have made more of an effort to understand our business needs and what we can do with exisiting data and using it to aid decision making for the time being.


<h3 class="PostH1"> My overall thoughts: </h3>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Pros</th>
<th>Cons</th>

<tr>
<td> <li> Structure of the day was great</li></td>
<td><li> Some talks became adverts to their product, no learning oppotunities</li></td>

<tr>
<td> <li> Data LDN app was useful for planning the day and view oppotunities</li></td>
<td><li> Too many similar products/ tools, nothing stood out well</li></td>

<tr>
<td> <li> Interesting Concepts covered such as, Data visualisation and cloud              computing</li></td>
<td><li> Scan Badges and take personal details, only to harrass you later!</li></td></tr>

<BR>

The day was an interesting in terms of concepts and tools being created and their purpose. It was great to see the value of 'good data' finally being noticed! Often people think quanitity over quality, which is not the case. Good data leads to good decision making and higher effeciency. 

The a common trend in industry at the moment is cloud based storage and this is propelled further by companies such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon, Who in turn have created cloud based software such as Microsoft Azure (Which is use), AWS and Google Cloud Platform. - This trend is true as i'm currently working a lot in the Azure space myself using facilities such as Data Lake, Data Warehouse, SQL server and Database. 

Another common trend I noticed was companies are organising their data to try to take advantage of AI. This concept requires good, organised, structured data to work effectively. IBM have createed a tool named 'Watson' which can be deployed to help business create AI for themselves.
